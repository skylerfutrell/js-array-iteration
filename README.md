⭐ JavaScript Array Iteration | Change the Ref Events Page

⭐ Created by Skyler Futrell

📌 Project Overview: This project is a simple interactive events webpage, showcasing a dynamically generated list of upcoming events. The page features a typewriter effect for engaging text animations, smooth scroll-based animations for a visually appealing experience, and dynamic event rendering powered by JavaScript. Users can explore key event details, including dates, locations, and descriptions, with links to external resources for further engagement. The webpage is designed to be both aesthetically compelling and user-friendly.

🚀 Features:

✅ Dynamic Typewriter Effect: Engages users with smooth animated text.

✅ Interactive Event List: Displays upcoming events dynamically from an array.

✅ Smooth Animations: Fade-in effects and hover highlights for a modern feel.

✅ Optimized for GitHub Pages: No additional setup required.

📂 Files:
  1. index.html
     - Contains the structure of the webpage, including the main content sections, headings, and placeholders for dynamically inserted elements such as event listings and images.
     It also links to external stylesheets and scripts for styling and interactivity.
  2. styles.css
     - Defines the styling for the webpage, including layout design, typography, colors, animations, and responsive adjustments to ensure a visually appealing and accessible user experience across different screen sizes.
     It also includes styles for dynamic elements such as fade-in effects and hover interactions.
  3. script.js
     - Manages the interactive functionality of the webpage, including the typewriter effect for text animation, dynamic population of event data, image and button content insertion, hover effects, and smooth fade-in animations on 
     scroll. It also enhances user engagement by handling event listeners and applying visual highlights to elements.
